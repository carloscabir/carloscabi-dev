# Carlos Cabi Portfolio
This portfolio website is designed to showcase my skills and experience as a developer.
Made from scratch with Astro.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Local Setup
### Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine. You can download them from the official website: Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

### Steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

```Bash
git clone https://your-github-repo.git
```

2.  Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory:

```Bash
cd your-portfolio-project
```
3.  Then, install the project's dependencies:
```Bash
npm install
```
(If you use yarn, replace npm install with yarn install.)

4. Run the Development Server:
Start the Astro development server to view your portfolio locally:
```Bash
npm run dev
```
(Again, use yarn dev if you use yarn.)

### Additional Notes:
- You can customize the development server port by modifying the configuration in your `astro.config.mjs` file (if present).

- If your project requires any additional setup steps, be sure to include them here.
